# Gamified-study
 A website to make your learning journey a game.
My objective is to make a website or app (I'm still deciding as I'm super new to coding) where you have a path to learning something, and you have levels, with a set to-do list, and you only unlock the next level when you finish. at the beginning of each level, there's a chest with the resources you'll use for that level.

My final objective is a website that turns something that can be overwhelming into a "game where you only have to focus on something one level at a time.The website also has a Pomodoro timer cause why not.

I'm a beginner, so any help is welcome. Please. I'm desperate.
